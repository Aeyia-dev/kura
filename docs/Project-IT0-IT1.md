# Aeyia Platform - 4-Week Plan for Iteration 0 & Technical Spike 1


Detailed 4-week plan for Iteration 0 (foundation setup) and our first technical spike focusing on video session platforms. 

This initial phase will establish our development environment and help us make informed decisions about critical platform components.

## Iteration 0: Foundation Setup (Weeks 1-2)

### Week 1: Development Environment & Infrastructure
- **Monday-Tuesday**: Set up development environment with standardized tooling
- **Wednesday**: Configure CI/CD pipelines with automated testing
- **Thursday**: Establish development, staging, and production environments
- **Friday**: Complete infrastructure-as-code setup for AWS environments

**Deliverables:**
- Complete development environment documentation
- Working CI/CD pipeline with test automation
- Infrastructure deployment scripts

### Week 2: Core Framework & Architecture
- **Monday-Tuesday**: Set up application architecture and core components
- **Wednesday**: Implement authentication framework skeleton
- **Thursday**: Create API gateway and service interfaces
- **Friday**: Complete database schemas and repository patterns

**Deliverables:**
- Application architecture documentation
- Working authentication framework
- Sample API endpoints with documentation
- Database schema and migration scripts

## Technical Spike 1: Video Session Platform (Weeks 3-4)

### Week 3: AWS Chime Evaluation
- **Monday**: Set up AWS Chime SDK testing environment
- **Tuesday-Wednesday**: Implement test application with core features:
  * Video conferencing with multiple participants
  * Screen sharing and recording capabilities
  * File sharing during sessions
- **Thursday**: Conduct performance testing under various network conditions
- **Friday**: Document security features and compliance capabilities

**Deliverables:**
- AWS Chime test implementation
- Performance test results
- Security and compliance assessment

### Week 4: Stream Evaluation & Comparison
- **Monday**: Set up Stream SDK testing environment
- **Tuesday-Wednesday**: Implement test application with the same core features
- **Thursday**: Run comparative performance and user experience testing
- **Friday**: Complete analysis and prepare recommendation

**Deliverables:**
- Stream test implementation
- Comparative analysis document
- Final recommendation with cost projections
- Implementation approach for the selected platform

## Weekly Check-ins

We'll hold brief check-in meetings every Monday and Thursday at [time] to provide updates and address any questions or concerns. Additionally, we'll deliver a written progress report each Friday.

## Next Steps

Upon completion of Iteration 0 and this first technical spike, we'll have:
1. A fully operational development environment
2. Clear direction on our video platform strategy
3. Detailed knowledge of implementation requirements for the chosen solution

Based on these findings, we'll finalize the implementation plan for our next development iterations focusing on core user journeys.

Please let me know if you'd like to discuss any aspects of this plan or if you need any clarification.

Looking forward to getting started!
