## User Flow Relationships

The platform components connect through a series of logical progressions that create the complete user journey:

1. Users discover the platform through the marketing site, then either create an account or explore practitioners
2. After authentication, clients discover practitioners or practitioners begin verification
3. From discovery, users either book a discovery call or proceed directly to booking
4. After a discovery call, users typically book regular sessions
5. Booking leads to pre-session preparation, then the actual session
6. Post-session, users may book again, access content, or join the community
7. Membership provides access to various platform features throughout the journey
8. Support and financial operations are accessible across the entire user experience
