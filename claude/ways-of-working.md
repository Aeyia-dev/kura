# Ways of Working

Note: The laravel codebase root is at ./web/

## Development Process

1. **Plan Before Implementation**:
   - All changes must be planned and documented in the list file claude/TODO.md stop and add your checklist in here first.
   - Make the changes nessesary and sufficient - make the changes as simple as possible
   - dont delete any content from claude/TODO.md. oinly add or check tasks off. leave all other content in tact.
   - Get the plan approved before making any actual code changes
   - Prepare all related changes to be applied in a single batch, not incrementally

2. **Implementation**:
   - After approval, implement all changes at once
   - Use batch operations when making multiple related changes
   - Do not make unrelated changes without a separate planning and approval process

3. **Review**:
   - After implementation, summarize the changes made
   - Ensure all work matches the approved plan
   - move completed tasks under the done heading
