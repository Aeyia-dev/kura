# Ways of Working

## Development Process

1. **Plan Before Implementation**:
   - All changes must be planned and documented in a markdown file (e.g., `landing.md` for landing page changes)
   - Get the plan approved before making any actual code changes
   - Prepare all related changes to be applied in a single batch, not incrementally

2. **Implementation**:
   - After approval, implement all changes at once
   - Use batch operations when making multiple related changes
   - Do not make unrelated changes without a separate planning and approval process

3. **Review**:
   - After implementation, summarize the changes made
   - Ensure all work matches the approved plan
   - move completed tasks under the done heading
